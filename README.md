Rods is a multiplatform game, similar to the classic DOS game Pipes.

You get a grid of rods, of which one is the source. Each rod has 1 to 4 legs, 
with which it can connect to nearby rods. You have to rotate the rods until all 
are connected to the source.

The game aims to be multiplatform. I am developing it on Intel MacOS 13 and 
support for Windows and Linux (Ubuntu), will be added.

To compile, execute the build script.
